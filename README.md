# Linear Algebra Game
Welcome to the linear algebra game! It is a learning tool for Duke University’s introductory linear algebra course “Math 221: Linear Algebra and Applications.” It also introduces you to Lean: a proof assistant that provides an environment and language to encode proofs formally. The linear algebra game is intended to supplement your studies in 221. While in class you will learn to write traditional proofs (in natural language), the game will show you how to approach such proofs formally. A formal proof is written in precise syntax and can be checked algorithmically by a computer program called a proof assistant.
